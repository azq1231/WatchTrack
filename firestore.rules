/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict, user-centric ownership model for a video tracking application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model ensures that all user-generated data is private by default.
 * Users can only create, read, update, or delete their own information. There is no
 * concept of public data or shared access between users. This provides a strong
 * security posture, guaranteeing user data privacy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically. Each user has a root document at `/users/{userId}`.
 * All data specific to that user, such as their tracked videos, is stored in a
 * subcollection (`/users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}`). This structure makes it simple
 * to secure an entire tree of a user's data with a single path-based rule.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing Disabled: To protect user privacy and prevent data scraping, it is
 *   not possible to query or list the top-level `/users` collection.
 * - Path-Based Security: Ownership is determined by the `{userId}` wildcard in the
 *   document path. The rules verify that the requesting user's authenticated UID
 *   matches this `{userId}`. This is highly performant as it avoids extra database reads.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation, rules enforce that internal ID fields
 *   (e.g., `Video.userId`) correctly match the user ID from the path.
 *   On updates, these IDs are enforced as immutable to prevent re-associating data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `Video` documents contain a denormalized `userId` field. This allows the rules
 * to enforce on `create` that a user is correctly associating a new video with their
 * own ID, preventing them from creating records on behalf of another user. This
 * check ensures relational integrity without needing cross-document reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The model uses structural segregation by placing private `videos` within a user-specific
 * subcollection. This is inherently more secure and performant for list operations
 * than a single top-level `/videos` collection filtered by an owner ID.
