    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to be secure and scalable. It uses path-based ownership for user-owned data (videos), where a user's data is stored under their unique user ID (`/users/{userId}`). This structural segregation naturally enforces privacy and security. The critical insight is that we *do not* need to check for the existence of the parent user document (`/users/{userId}`) when a user performs actions on their own `videos` subcollection. The security rules for `/users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}` only need to verify that `request.auth.uid == userId`. This allows a user to be created via Firebase Authentication and immediately start writing to their own subcollection without a preliminary write to create their user document, thus avoiding race conditions and permission errors for newly-created users. This 'lazy' creation of the user document is more robust. The `User` entity itself is still defined for clarity and can be created or updated by the user at any time."
